00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,040
<v Narrator>Let's first start with our</v>

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,440
Classic Load Balancers

3
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,710
and these may not be as prominent in the exam

4
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,100
but they may still be mentioned

5
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,720
and they're still very valid load balancers.

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,800
So they support two things,

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,360
the TCP or traffic or

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,663
HTTP and HTTPS.

9
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,317
And TCP is called layer four

10
00:00:18,317 --> 00:00:20,700
and HTTP and HTTPS is called layer seven.

11
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,530
I'm not gonna get too deep about what these layers

12
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,370
mean but just know that TCP is layer four

13
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,350
and the other two are layer seven.

14
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,240
So the health checks are either TCP based

15
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,870
or HTTP based and what you will get

16
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,220
out of a load balancer or classic load balancer

17
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,190
is a fixed hostname and we'll see this

18
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,470
in the hands-on as well.

19
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,290
So what we'll set up in this lecture is a client

20
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,610
talking to our classic load balancer

21
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,580
on an HTTP listener.

22
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,210
And internally that CLB will be redirecting

23
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,770
the traffic into our EC2 instances.

24
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,400
So let's have a look at how we can do this in the console.

25
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,860
We have my second instance that's already created

26
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,710
and running our HTTP server.

27
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,670
And so if you go to this IP and press enter we get back the

28
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,300
Hello World from our instance so this is correct.

29
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,310
Now let's go ahead and create our classic load balancer.

30
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,320
So for this I'm going to scroll down

31
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,790
and go to load balancers.

32
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,790
And I'm going to go ahead and create a load balancer.

33
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:16,070
So we have three choices and we're going to choose

34
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,940
classic load balancer which is the previous generation

35
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,290
but don't worry we will get to application load balancer

36
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,320
and network load balancers which you can see

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,350
from this screen AWS is kind of pushing for

38
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:28,670
us to use the ALB and the NLB more than this CLB.

39
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:29,503
Okay?

40
00:01:29,503 --> 00:01:33,270
But for this exercise we'll just use classic load balancer.

41
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,180
Click on create and then we have to give it a name

42
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,180
so my first CLB and then we need to choose the VPC

43
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,880
so I'll choose my default VPC.

44
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,480
Is it an internal balancer or external one?

45
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,050
If it's internal we're not going

46
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,560
to be able to publicly access it

47
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,500
so we'll leave this un-ticked.

48
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,670
And do we want advanced VPC configuration?

49
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,690
For now we will not tick this box.

50
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,470
The listener configuration is saying what is our CLB

51
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,910
going to be listened onto?

52
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,780
So it's going to have the port 80 which is HTTP

53
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,550
and it will be back-talking to our

54
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:09,160
instance on port 80 on HTTP.

55
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,270
So this looks good, this is classic.

56
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,080
And I'm going to assign security group.

57
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,070
Here I'm going to create a new security group,

58
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:21,070
and I'm going to call it my first load balancer

59
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,140
and it will be my first load balancer security group, okay?

60
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,850
Now what it will allow is to allow anyone on port 80

61
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,210
from anywhere to access our load balancer

62
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,440
which is what we need because we want to access our

63
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,380
newly created load balancer.

64
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,080
Then for security settings there is nothing on HTTPS

65
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,100
so we get this warning but this is fine.

66
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,300
Then for health checks, we need to

67
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,380
set up a health check for our instance.

68
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,080
So it's saying okay you need to use the HTTP

69
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,820
protocol on port 80 and then need to

70
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,570
ping on this specific path.

71
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,200
And if I leave this as /.index.HTML will this work?

72
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,250
Let's add /.index.HTML and press enter.

73
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,440
As you can see this still works so we can keep

74
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,170
this ping path as is.

75
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,280
But if we wanted to we can also just

76
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,840
not have index.HTML and remove that part.

77
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,940
That's all up to you, it's the exact same thing

78
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,270
in this example.

79
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,740
Now for the advanced details,

80
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,980
how long are we waiting for a response?

81
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,500
How often do we want to talk to our instance?

82
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,242
Maybe you want to talk to it every five seconds.

83
00:03:25,242 --> 00:03:27,880
After how many failed health checks is

84
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,250
my instance going to be unhealthy?

85
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,650
We'll set it as two.

86
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,340
And after how many successful health checks is it healthy?

87
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,000
We'll set it as five.

88
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,274
Click on add EC2 instances and here we're about

89
00:03:38,274 --> 00:03:39,530
to add our second instance directly

90
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,830
into our classic load balancer.

91
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,123
And click on add tags.

92
00:03:44,244 --> 00:03:46,640
And click on review and create and create.

93
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,060
Now the load balancer is being created

94
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,170
and we need to review and resolve this.

95
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,590
Obviously the health check is no good so

96
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,990
we need to have a interval of maybe ten seconds

97
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,810
so that it is greater than the response time out obviously.

98
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,330
So I'll just fix that real quick and go again.

99
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,850
And click on create and now everything should be working.

100
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,390
Okay, so our CLB is now being created and we

101
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,630
have to wait for it to be provisioned

102
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,655
so as you can see now it is being provisioned.

103
00:04:13,655 --> 00:04:16,280
Our classic load balancer is now created and if you

104
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,750
go to instances one of them is in service.

105
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,530
It took it a while to get in service but now it's

106
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:24,000
in service, that means that it's passing the health checks.

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,430
And therefore my load balancer is ready.

108
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,960
So if I use this DNS name right here,

109
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,640
copy this entire DNS name, open a new tab and add it.

110
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,660
As we can see using this DNS name,

111
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,010
we get the Hello World from the same IP as before.

112
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,580
So if I go back to my EC2 instance and refresh this page

113
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,520
I get the exact same message so this CLB is working

114
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,720
because it is responding the exact same way

115
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,410
as my EC2 instance because it's actually

116
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:52,140
my EC2 instance responding behind my load balancer, okay?

117
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,230
The thing is now we have a load balancer and it's

118
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,350
in front of our instance and we're able to access

119
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,020
both our instance and our load balancer at the same time.

120
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,120
So this is kind of problematic,

121
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,940
we want to be able to only access our load balancer

122
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,930
to expose that and not expose our EC2 instances directly.

123
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,150
So for this we need to go back to security groups

124
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,120
and do a little bit of changes.

125
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,010
So let's go to security groups

126
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,430
and here we have my first load balancer security group

127
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,570
and my first security group

128
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,880
which was attached to our EC2 instance.

129
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,680
So I'm going to click on my first load balancer,

130
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,650
inbound, and this looks good.

131
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,940
We're saying that any traffic on HTTP

132
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,860
on port 80 can access our load balancer.

133
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,890
But if we got to my security group this is too open,

134
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,613
we're saying anyone, anywhere can access HTTP.

135
00:05:37,613 --> 00:05:39,840
But what we want to do is change this

136
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,540
and say not anyone from anywhere

137
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,630
but someone from, and you type sg,

138
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,560
someone from my first load balancer only

139
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,920
can access my EC2 instance.

140
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,610
And so instead of saying allow HTTP traffic

141
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:57,330
from anywhere we can say from my load balancer only.

142
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,990
And so once this is done and we save this,

143
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,390
now we're saying okay

144
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,800
just traffic that is coming from my load balancer

145
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,190
can go into my EC2 instances.

146
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,210
So if I go back to my CLB, and refresh,

147
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,380
as you can see this still works.

148
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,250
I still get the response Hello World,

149
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,960
but now if I go to this and press on refresh,

150
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,670
you can see here on the top of my screen this is spinning.

151
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,480
And so this looks like a time out and as you remember,

152
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,990
whenever there is a timeout issue

153
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,110
that means that this is a security group working

154
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,420
and not providing access to our instance.

155
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,830
So that our EC2 instance right now

156
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,140
is not accessible directly,

157
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,980
it can only be accessed through our CLB and it

158
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,060
will time out if we try to access the IP directly.

159
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,970
So here we have set up a much better security mechanism,

160
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,893
because the only entry point into our EC2 instances

161
00:06:45,893 --> 00:06:48,820
is through our load balancer.

162
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,050
So this is quite cool.

163
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,110
And something we can do now is add more instances.

164
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,830
So if we go back to our instances right here

165
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:59,830
and I right click, and I do launch more like this,

166
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,090
and I can look at the instance details

167
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,450
and there is some user data so this is perfect.

168
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,720
It's going to reuse the same user data.

169
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,850
We say okay, we're going to launch one of them.

170
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:14,720
And we have one more and maybe we should launch another one.

171
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,700
So I'll actually launch this instance again.

172
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,370
Right click, launch more like this.

173
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:25,440
And then I will actually edit my instance detail this time.

174
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,770
Just to review it so,

175
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,120
let's click on previous, previous, previous

176
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,140
and what I want to change is the availability zone

177
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,730
so right now it's going into EU west 3C

178
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:38,380
but I want to launch it in a different one, 3A for example.

179
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,853
And go back and review and launch.

180
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,390
Okay, everything looks good.

181
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:47,150
So now our three instances are being launched right here.

182
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:51,530
And what I have to do is go to my load balancer,

183
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,570
which is on the left-hand side.

184
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,280
And here I need to edit my instances.

185
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,660
And I'm going to add these two instances right here

186
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,960
so up, they're all going to be added, and click on save.

187
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,450
And now we have three instances

188
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,200
attached to our load balancer.

189
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,380
Two of them are out of service

190
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,290
because they are still launching

191
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,520
so let me wait a little bit

192
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,480
until they have checked passes.

193
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,814
So now our three instances are in service.

194
00:08:12,814 --> 00:08:17,814
We have two in EU west 3C and one in EU west 3A

195
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:22,660
and so if I go to my load balancer and refresh this page,

196
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,630
I should be seeing the IP changing every single time.

197
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,941
So as you can see because the IP changes every single time

198
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:30,710
that means that our load balancer is actually getting

199
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,850
responses from our three EC2 instances one at a time.

200
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,410
And so this is really cool because right now we are showing

201
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,840
what it's like to do load balancing okay?

202
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,010
Whoa that's awesome.

203
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,100
All right so that's it for this lecture.

204
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,700
I will not be using this CLB in the future

205
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,400
so what you can do is right click and then delete.

206
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,170
And then we'll be done with this CLB.

207
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:53,220
But we'll keep our EC2 instances for the next hands-on,

208
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,123
so I will see you in the next lecture.
