1
00:00:00,404 --> 00:00:02,832
<v Stephane>Okay, so now I am in the AWS console</v>

2
00:00:02,832 --> 00:00:04,091
and that's the main page you see

3
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:05,814
when you start with AWS.

4
00:00:05,814 --> 00:00:08,421
Now, in the area services, you can click on services

5
00:00:08,421 --> 00:00:11,526
and see all of them and you will not learn all of them

6
00:00:11,526 --> 00:00:13,712
'cause that's probably ages to learn all of them,

7
00:00:13,712 --> 00:00:15,350
but what we'll learn is the most important ones

8
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,104
for the certification exam.

9
00:00:17,104 --> 00:00:19,434
The first one we should get started with is IAM.

10
00:00:19,434 --> 00:00:20,948
Now, you can also look in there

11
00:00:20,948 --> 00:00:22,881
and find that IAM is right here,

12
00:00:22,881 --> 00:00:25,297
but, as a developer, what I like to do is to be efficient,

13
00:00:25,297 --> 00:00:26,916
so anytime I need to find a service,

14
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:28,663
I'll usually type it in the bar.

15
00:00:28,663 --> 00:00:30,537
I'll type IAM, and it'll give you a link

16
00:00:30,537 --> 00:00:31,840
straight to the service.

17
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,019
To me, I find this a little bit easier.

18
00:00:34,019 --> 00:00:35,842
Now, when we start with IAM, as we see,

19
00:00:35,842 --> 00:00:37,788
it's a global service, as I said. Okay?

20
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:40,998
The user is a roles; everything is credit globally.

21
00:00:40,998 --> 00:00:41,923
Now, as you can see, we start

22
00:00:41,923 --> 00:00:44,241
and we have almost nothing in our accounts.

23
00:00:44,241 --> 00:00:46,894
We have zero users, zero groups. We have two roles,

24
00:00:46,894 --> 00:00:49,889
but these are roles, basically, created by AWS for us,

25
00:00:49,889 --> 00:00:52,989
and we get a security status that doesn't look good for now.

26
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:55,213
It says what you need to do to make sure

27
00:00:55,213 --> 00:00:57,052
that your AWS account is secure.

28
00:00:57,052 --> 00:01:00,089
So, this is exactly what we have to do right now.

29
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:03,053
The first one is delete your root access key.

30
00:01:03,053 --> 00:01:05,855
The root access key provide access to your AWS accounts,

31
00:01:05,855 --> 00:01:08,169
and you should never use them. Okay?

32
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:09,339
So, never ever use them.

33
00:01:09,339 --> 00:01:11,375
Basically, we'll have to delete them,

34
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,951
and throw them away.

35
00:01:12,951 --> 00:01:16,146
Now we can activate MFA for multi-factor authentication

36
00:01:16,146 --> 00:01:17,231
on our root accounts.

37
00:01:17,231 --> 00:01:18,339
I want to do this right now.

38
00:01:18,339 --> 00:01:20,875
Basically, you click on manage MFA,

39
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:22,825
and, then, basically, you say, "Okay"

40
00:01:22,825 --> 00:01:24,341
we're accessing the credentials page.

41
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:26,425
We say continue to credentials,

42
00:01:26,425 --> 00:01:30,165
and we can enable MFA, and click on activate MFA.

43
00:01:30,165 --> 00:01:32,593
Then, you can choose whether to it's a virtual or hardware.

44
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,482
If it's a virtual, like me, you can use an application,

45
00:01:35,482 --> 00:01:38,317
such as, Google authenticator, for this.

46
00:01:38,317 --> 00:01:39,802
I'll let you do it, but, basically,

47
00:01:39,802 --> 00:01:43,668
you can download Google authenticator, and do this.

48
00:01:43,668 --> 00:01:45,765
What you have to do when you open Google authenticator

49
00:01:45,765 --> 00:01:49,510
is to scan this QR code, so you scan the barcode,

50
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,670
and, then, once the barcode is recognized,

51
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,587
it's going to give you two authentication code.

52
00:01:54,587 --> 00:01:56,087
For me, 662

53
00:01:56,087 --> 00:01:56,978
498,

54
00:01:56,978 --> 00:01:59,477
and this will appear in your app directly,

55
00:01:59,477 --> 00:02:01,423
and, then, you need to wait a little bit,

56
00:02:01,423 --> 00:02:03,867
okay, until the next code arrives,

57
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:06,144
and then enter that code.

58
00:02:06,144 --> 00:02:08,227
My second code is 327933,

59
00:02:09,858 --> 00:02:12,116
and then activate my MFA, and great.

60
00:02:12,116 --> 00:02:14,892
The MFA was successfully associated.

61
00:02:14,892 --> 00:02:17,061
Basically, now, our root account is protected

62
00:02:17,061 --> 00:02:19,293
by multi-factor authentication,

63
00:02:19,293 --> 00:02:22,245
and I'm sure that only me, with my own personal device

64
00:02:22,245 --> 00:02:24,029
can log in to AWS.

65
00:02:24,029 --> 00:02:25,713
I feel much better about it, and, now,

66
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:26,985
we have a green tick.

67
00:02:26,985 --> 00:02:29,929
Now, we need to create individual IAM users.

68
00:02:29,929 --> 00:02:32,483
To create users, it's, basically, create our first users,

69
00:02:32,483 --> 00:02:35,443
so click on manage users, and add a user,

70
00:02:35,443 --> 00:02:37,986
and I'll create my own super user,

71
00:02:37,986 --> 00:02:41,682
and I'll call it "Stephane". Stephane. That's me.

72
00:02:41,682 --> 00:02:43,677
What type of access do I want to give myself?

73
00:02:43,677 --> 00:02:45,645
Well, I want to give myself a programmatic access.

74
00:02:45,645 --> 00:02:47,389
That's for sure, and, also,

75
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:50,079
the AWS management console access,

76
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,728
so that I can use a password

77
00:02:51,728 --> 00:02:53,794
to sign into my management console.

78
00:02:53,794 --> 00:02:55,549
Now we can choose an autogenerated password or

79
00:02:55,549 --> 00:02:58,231
a custom password. We'll just keep it autogenerated.

80
00:02:58,231 --> 00:02:59,974
Then, basically, when I first log in,

81
00:02:59,974 --> 00:03:02,782
it's going to require a password resets.

82
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,475
Then, I click on next permissions,

83
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:07,744
and, basically, I say whatever I want and stuff.

84
00:03:07,744 --> 00:03:09,844
We can add a user to a group or

85
00:03:09,844 --> 00:03:13,159
copy permission from an existing user or attach policies.

86
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,245
For me, I'll just attach directly policies,

87
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:16,572
just to be quick,

88
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:19,437
and I'll give myself an administrator access.

89
00:03:19,437 --> 00:03:22,783
Basically, I want to use the accounts to do my course.

90
00:03:22,783 --> 00:03:25,218
I'll give myself administrator access,

91
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:28,174
and, basically, if you look at the permission boundary,

92
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,542
you can just create it without one,

93
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:31,774
because this is an advanced feature,

94
00:03:31,774 --> 00:03:33,708
and we don't need it right now.

95
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:36,217
We click on next to review, and, basically,

96
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:38,739
it says, "Okay", here is me. That's Stephane,

97
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:41,312
and the permissions I have is, I have administrator access,

98
00:03:41,312 --> 00:03:42,362
which is great,

99
00:03:42,362 --> 00:03:44,111
and I have it so I can change my own password,

100
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:45,732
which is great as well, right?

101
00:03:45,732 --> 00:03:48,316
I'll go ahead and click on create,

102
00:03:48,316 --> 00:03:51,394
and, all of a sudden, my user is created.

103
00:03:51,394 --> 00:03:54,165
Basically, I successfully generated a user,

104
00:03:54,165 --> 00:03:57,320
and I can view and download the security credentials

105
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,085
for that user if I wanted to,

106
00:03:59,085 --> 00:04:00,826
so I click on download .csv, and this is something

107
00:04:00,826 --> 00:04:03,804
I'm not showing you, and you should not see, okay?

108
00:04:03,804 --> 00:04:05,861
Basically, this guarantees that I have a user,

109
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:07,391
and, then, once that page is gone,

110
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:10,355
I won't be able to see it again. Okay?

111
00:04:10,355 --> 00:04:13,757
I'll close this page, and now we're good.

112
00:04:13,757 --> 00:04:16,675
We have Stephane as a user, and what I'll do is,

113
00:04:16,675 --> 00:04:20,594
I will re-log in to my page very soon as this user.

114
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,960
Now, if we go back to the dashboard,

115
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,023
we can also have groups, okay?

116
00:04:24,023 --> 00:04:25,612
What we have as groups is, basically,

117
00:04:25,612 --> 00:04:27,115
group the users together, such as,

118
00:04:27,115 --> 00:04:30,617
we can know and group permissions and save a bit of time.

119
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:32,712
Manage a group, create a new group,

120
00:04:32,712 --> 00:04:36,200
and, for this, I'll call new group "admin", okay?

121
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,668
I'll click on next step,

122
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:40,796
and I'll give administrator access to that group.

123
00:04:40,796 --> 00:04:43,135
Click on next step, and, then, create the group.

124
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,875
Very simple, I create a group called admin,

125
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:45,819
but you can create a group name whatever,

126
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:49,496
developers, whatever, and create the group.

127
00:04:49,496 --> 00:04:52,184
Now, the group admin, basically, has it's own permissions,

128
00:04:52,184 --> 00:04:54,452
and the permission's administrator access.

129
00:04:54,452 --> 00:04:57,717
What I want to do is add my users to my group.

130
00:04:57,717 --> 00:05:00,336
This is myself. I'll add Stephane to this group.

131
00:05:00,336 --> 00:05:02,752
Now we can see that Stephane is part of the administrators,

132
00:05:02,752 --> 00:05:06,384
and, as such, you will inherit the permission of that group.

133
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:09,265
What I can do is, I can go back to the users now.

134
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:12,021
Go to Stephane, and what I can do directly,

135
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:14,704
is detach these permissions,

136
00:05:14,704 --> 00:05:16,073
because they are attached directly,

137
00:05:16,073 --> 00:05:17,892
and it's not very manageable,

138
00:05:17,892 --> 00:05:21,068
so I can detach this administrator access,

139
00:05:21,068 --> 00:05:23,959
which was attached through the group, okay?

140
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,759
Now, we have a much better set up,

141
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,276
because my administrator access has been provided

142
00:05:28,276 --> 00:05:29,760
for the group.

143
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,976
This all looks great, and then, finally,

144
00:05:31,976 --> 00:05:35,154
we can apply an IAM password policy.

145
00:05:35,154 --> 00:05:37,263
Now, an IAM password policy is, basically,

146
00:05:37,263 --> 00:05:39,362
to guarantee that IAM users, such as, myself

147
00:05:39,362 --> 00:05:40,635
will create strong password,

148
00:05:40,635 --> 00:05:42,370
and these password will change often,

149
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,438
because I don't want passwords to hang around for a year.

150
00:05:45,438 --> 00:05:46,788
If I click on password policy,

151
00:05:46,788 --> 00:05:49,598
you can see all the requirements that there is,

152
00:05:49,598 --> 00:05:52,197
but, basically, you wanna choose a minimum length.

153
00:05:52,197 --> 00:05:54,405
Allow users to change their own password,

154
00:05:54,405 --> 00:05:58,752
and, maybe, I wanna expire passwords after 90 days, okay?

155
00:05:58,752 --> 00:06:00,012
That sounds about right,

156
00:06:00,012 --> 00:06:02,401
but you can use whatever requirement you want.

157
00:06:02,401 --> 00:06:04,911
I'll apply the password policy,

158
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:06,234
and we should be good.

159
00:06:06,234 --> 00:06:09,208
Now, all here is green, and, as I said,

160
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:13,296
I do not agree for anyone to use the root accounts,

161
00:06:13,296 --> 00:06:15,960
so what we'll do is go to customize,

162
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,652
and we create an account, yes,

163
00:06:17,652 --> 00:06:22,652
I'll call it "dataacumulus-courses", and I'll set yes,

164
00:06:22,691 --> 00:06:25,179
create, and, basically, now,

165
00:06:25,179 --> 00:06:28,260
the IAM user sign-in link is right here.

166
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,517
This link is what I will use to sign in to my AWS console.

167
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:35,970
I'll go and tab and click on console,

168
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,329
and, right here, I have the IAM user name,

169
00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:39,720
which is gonna be Stephane,

170
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,229
and I need to set the password,

171
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:42,901
and the password is the one that you got

172
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:45,674
from the credentials; that .csv file.

173
00:06:45,674 --> 00:06:47,085
What I'll do is that, basically,

174
00:06:47,085 --> 00:06:49,292
I'm going to my credentials .csv file,

175
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:52,027
and you can't see it. I copy and paste the password,

176
00:06:52,027 --> 00:06:53,763
and sign in. Now that I'm sign in,

177
00:06:53,763 --> 00:06:57,622
as you can see, I must change my password to continue.

178
00:06:57,622 --> 00:07:00,931
I paste my old password, and I'll just type a new password

179
00:07:00,931 --> 00:07:02,828
that I'll generate and fill using my password manager,

180
00:07:02,828 --> 00:07:03,997
but you can type whatever you want,

181
00:07:03,997 --> 00:07:05,635
just make sure it's secure,

182
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:09,383
and, then, I'll confirm the password change.

183
00:07:09,383 --> 00:07:11,194
Now, as you can see, on the top right,

184
00:07:11,194 --> 00:07:13,730
I am logged in as the IAM user, Stephane

185
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,871
in my account, dataacumulus-courses.

186
00:07:15,871 --> 00:07:17,825
Once you have IAM user, this is, basically,

187
00:07:17,825 --> 00:07:19,911
saying, "Hey. I'm not using the root account anymore.

188
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:22,136
I'm using this user that I created from before",

189
00:07:22,136 --> 00:07:24,362
and this is a much better thing to do.

190
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:26,637
If I go back to IAM, as you can see,

191
00:07:26,637 --> 00:07:29,018
everything looks complete. Everything looks good,

192
00:07:29,018 --> 00:07:31,515
and I'm created and I have all the users

193
00:07:31,515 --> 00:07:32,916
and rights that I want.

194
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,909
That's it for the set up, just remember,

195
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:36,243
really, really, really important

196
00:07:36,243 --> 00:07:39,162
for you to set up a user that has admin access

197
00:07:39,162 --> 00:07:42,030
and use that user instead of your root accounts.

198
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,569
That's about it, and I will see you in the next lecture

199
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:46,287
for some much more funner stuff.
