1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,640
<v Instructor>Okay so we're getting into</v>

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,393
first of all the IAM service in AWS.

3
00:00:05,393 --> 00:00:08,220
IAM stands for Identity and Access Management,

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,160
and as you can expect from the name

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,190
that basically means users.

6
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,830
So the whole of your AWS security is going to be in IAM.

7
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,340
There's gonna be users, groups and roles.

8
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,819
You have to remember this and you surely will remember them

9
00:00:20,819 --> 00:00:22,330
by the end of this course.

10
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,920
Root account is the account

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,980
with which you create your AWS accounts.

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,020
And basically you should only use it the very first time

13
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,690
and then you should never use it again

14
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,410
or even share it with someone,

15
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,217
because your root account is the accounts

16
00:00:34,217 --> 00:00:36,940
and the user that has the most power.

17
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,370
The users then must be created with proper permissions

18
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,450
and we'll see how to do this in the lab.

19
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,570
And IAM is going to be at the center of AWS,

20
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,440
so every service in AWS is going to be helped

21
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,340
with IAM for security.

22
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,140
Now we'll have policies within IAM

23
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,470
and these policies will be written in JSON.

24
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,040
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation

25
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,580
and they're basically a way to write data.

26
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,610
So if you don't know anything about JSON

27
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,990
I strongly recommend just going online

28
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,930
for a quick tutorial on Google to get started with JSON

29
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,730
because they just assume that as a developer

30
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,860
you probably know what that is.

31
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,490
So how do we visualize IAM at a high level?

32
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,840
Well we have the users, and the users is usually going to be

33
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,130
a physical person like you or me,

34
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,380
we are physical person.

35
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,050
So I will get an account in IAM

36
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,000
and you surely will get an account in IAM.

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,770
That account should not be the root account.

38
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,400
Now users can be grouped together.

39
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,860
And group is whatever you want it to be

40
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,490
but usually it's by functions, for example admin,

41
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,488
devops or by teams, such as engineering, design

42
00:01:39,488 --> 00:01:41,370
or anything you want.

43
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,480
Overall group, and you should know this,

44
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,380
contain users, okay.

45
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,630
So this way you can apply permissions to groups

46
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,620
and users will inherit these permissions.

47
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,360
Finally we have roles.

48
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,310
And roles are only for internal usage

49
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,640
within the AWS resources and services, okay.

50
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,510
So roles is what we're going to give to machines.

51
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,820
So this is a strong distinction to make.

52
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,400
Users is going to be for a physical person

53
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,070
and roles is going to be for a machine.

54
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,450
Now overall as I said, policies are JSON document

55
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,900
and they will define what each of these building blocks,

56
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,470
users, groups and roles, can and cannot do.

57
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,800
We'll learn how to write policies, don't worry

58
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,020
and we'll play with all these things at length

59
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,410
during this course.

60
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,120
Now IAM you should know has a global view.

61
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,820
When you create a user or a group or a role

62
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,790
in your AWS accounts it will be across all the regions

63
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,690
and that kind of makes sense.

64
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,150
As I said the policies are in JSON.

65
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,290
You can enable Multi Factor Authentication

66
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,250
for your root account and for your users,

67
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,390
and I strongly recommend it.

68
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,540
Now IAM comes with managed policies,

69
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,860
so basically you don't need to rewrite the whole policies,

70
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,940
you can reuse some that Amazon put together for you

71
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,640
for ease of management.

72
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,360
And we'll see in depth and length

73
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,840
how to create IAM policies.

74
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,210
Right now we'll just take it easy

75
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,370
and do a soft introduction.

76
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,860
Something you'll hear me say over and over and over

77
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,610
in this course it that it's best

78
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,400
to give users or roles the minimal amount

79
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,870
of permissions they need to perform the job,

80
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,440
and that's called the least privilege principles.

81
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,930
And so you absolutely want to make sure

82
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,960
that you don't over power any single person

83
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,800
in your organization or any single application or server.

84
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,640
And you will hear me say this so many times.

85
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,810
Now for big enterprises you use something

86
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,330
called IAM Federation.

87
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,780
We will not use it in this course

88
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,780
'cause we're not a big enterprise we're just users,

89
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,408
but basically if a big enterprise has like

90
00:03:40,408 --> 00:03:44,010
their own repository of users, such as Active Directory,

91
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,110
you know they can integrate this with IAM.

92
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,480
And this way the users of a big enterprise

93
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,720
can log into AWS using their company credentials.

94
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,200
This uses something called the SAML standard

95
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,770
and Microsoft Active Directory for example,

96
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,820
is one of these big users of the SAML standard.

97
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,800
So it's just something you need to know about for the exam

98
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,570
but we will not practice this.

99
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,140
So just a quick brain dump.

100
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,200
And I'm gonna feel like I'm your father right now

101
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,730
but I have to say it once,

102
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,288
'cause my conscience needs to be clear,

103
00:04:10,288 --> 00:04:13,500
one IAM user per physical person.

104
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,650
You do not share an IAM user with anyone.

105
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,180
Your account is your account and no one else's.

106
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,770
One IAM role per application.

107
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,690
Each application has it's own lifecycle,

108
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,500
their own independence and so you want one IAM role

109
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,920
per application, nothing shared.

110
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,090
Your IAM credentials should never be shared.

111
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:35,010
Again as I said, your IAM user and your credentials

112
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:38,540
are your own, you never share them with anyone.

113
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,030
Now never, ever, ever, ever,

114
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,500
I think I said it that many times,

115
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,050
write IAM credentials in code, ever.

116
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,280
This is extremely bad if you put your credentials in code

117
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,070
'cause if that code ends up in someone's hands

118
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,350
or on Github or on the Cloud or whatever

119
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,830
and someone intercepts them, I promise you someone

120
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,310
will mine bitcoin in your account

121
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:02,170
and you'll end up with a $20,000 bill in one day.

122
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,550
And that happened for real, you can Google it okay.

123
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,700
So never, ever, ever write IAM credentials in code, ever.

124
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,000
Never use your root account except for initial setup.

125
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,310
That's super important because the root account

126
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,810
is kind of the key to the kingdom.

127
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,410
If you lose it or if you compromise it, you're done.

128
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,320
So your root account is something you should create

129
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,640
at once and then lock in a safe and never use ever again.

130
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,250
So as I said never use the root IAM credentials.

131
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,410
Now I sound like someone who's trying to scare you

132
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,960
and I am and it's true.

133
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,590
Your AWS account can do a lot of things, okay

134
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,520
and can cost a lot of money if you misuse it

135
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,360
or someone misuses it for you,

136
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,280
so be careful around credentials and how you deal with them.

137
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,200
Apart from that, let's go in the next lecture

138
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,603
for the labs and hands on.
