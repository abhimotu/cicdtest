00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,150
<v Instructor>When we get started with Amazon,</v>

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:05,246
we have to talk about AWS regions.

3
00:00:05,246 --> 00:00:07,690
AWS has regions all around the world,

4
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,030
so you may have heard something like this

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,870
called us-east-1, or if you take, for example,

6
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:13,810
the Sydney region is called ap-southeast-2.

7
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,800
AWS has just a bunch of regions around the world,

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,190
and region is what you think it is.

9
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,640
It is, basically, somewhere in the world.

10
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,270
Each region will have Availability Zone.

11
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,910
Now, Availability Zone, we know and recognize them

12
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,380
because they end up with a letter,

13
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:31,380
so example, us-east-1a or us-east-1b, and so on.

14
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,500
The letters are A, B, C, D, E, and F,

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,670
can go up to six AZs so far.

16
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,870
So AZ is another word for Availability Zone,

17
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,520
and they're basically representing

18
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,044
physical data centers in a region,

19
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:46,591
so think like a huge data center somewhere in the world.

20
00:00:46,591 --> 00:00:49,220
All these Availability Zones, they're separate

21
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,140
from one another because they're

22
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,220
want to be separate from disasters,

23
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,450
so this is why we have multiple AZ in one region.

24
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,630
Each AWS region is basically built around

25
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,870
a minimum of three data center or Availability Zones,

26
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,070
and that's the basis of how Amazon works.

27
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:11,070
Each AWS Console now are region scoped, except IAM and S3.

28
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,670
Basically, when we go into the AWS UI,

29
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,300
as you'll see in a second, you will be scoped to a region,

30
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,300
and what that means is that when you

31
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,520
do changes or when you perform actions,

32
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,040
you will perform this action in a specific region.

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,660
Now the AZ themselves are a subset of the region,

34
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,690
but they're not shown in the console.

35
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,640
So if we go to the console right here,

36
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,200
we can see that right now, I am in the Paris region,

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,460
but if I click on the top right, I can see a dropdown

38
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,100
of all the regions for AWS that exist.

39
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,620
If I take a service, such as, for example, EC2,

40
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,730
we can see that when the EC2 pages load,

41
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,180
we can see that the region is still Paris, okay?

42
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,340
Whereas, if I go back to the console

43
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:52,240
and type in the center bar, I type IAM and click on IAM,

44
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,680
now I can see that IAM is a global service,

45
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,980
and in the top right it says global,

46
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,800
and then it says IAM does not require region selection.

47
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,260
So there's a few services that don't require a region,

48
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,238
there's a few services that do require a region.

49
00:02:04,238 --> 00:02:06,710
The best to work with when you start with Amazon

50
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,630
is to work in the region closest to you.

51
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,680
You can go to the Global Cloud Infrastructure

52
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,690
About AWS page, just Google Global Cloud Infrastructure,

53
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,860
and it will show you exactly on the map

54
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,810
where are all these regions and

55
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,990
how many AZs they have within them.

56
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,230
So basically we have the EU West region right here,

57
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,620
we have the US East, US West right here,

58
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,460
so there's a bunch of regions that you can see,

59
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,310
and within each region, they tell you

60
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,920
the number of AZs they have.

61
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,210
Now, for this tutorial, I want you to take a region

62
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,300
with at least three AZ, for this whole course,

63
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,140
because it really is the basis to me of how AWS works,

64
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,630
and that's pretty much the standard everywhere, so when you

65
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,780
do this tutorial, choose a region that is close to you.

66
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,960
If you live in Brazil, take a region in South America.

67
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,280
If you live near China, take the region

68
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,670
that is closest to you; if you live in the US,

69
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,100
do not choose Australia or Europe as your region.

70
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,810
That's just the basics, region and AZ,

71
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,460
and now we're ready to get started with Amazon Cloud.
