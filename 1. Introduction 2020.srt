00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,200
Okay, hello, cloggers.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,530
And thank you so much for taking this course.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,250
My colleague Mark Richman and I will be teaching you everything you need to know to pass the Certified

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,260
Solutions Architect Associate Exam.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,770
My name is Ryan Kronenburg.

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,300
I'm an A.W. community here and Alexa Champion, and I'm the co-founder of a Cloud Guru.

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,260
Over the last five years, a cloggers tolt cloud computing took over two million people suer and really,

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,490
really good hands.

9
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,220
In this course, we're going to assume that you have no prior A.W. s knowledge.

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,160
I didn't start out in tech myself.

11
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,510
I used to be an immigration lawyer.

12
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:35,100
And in 2010, I decided I wanted to retrain and I went to night school and I learnt cloud computing.

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,350
So I've done the exact same journey as you.

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,340
This course is really hands on.

15
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,800
It's not death by PowerPoint.

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,480
And the best way to learn a W.S. is to get your hands dirty in this course.

17
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,480
We're going to start by looking at a ten thousand foot overview of A.W. s.

18
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,190
They're going to move on to Identity Access Management in S3, but they're going to look at E.S. databases

19
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:54,690
advanced.

20
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,840
I am 53 VPC.

21
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:57,780
Hey, hey.

22
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,450
Architecture applications, security.

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,370
And then finally move on to Serverless and you're even going to learn how to build your very own Alexis

24
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:05,790
skill.

25
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,970
Like I said, this course is very hands on and you learn everything.

26
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,120
You need to know how to pass your exam as well as having lots of fun.

27
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,950
So let's go ahead and get started.
