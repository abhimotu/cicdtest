1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:00,710
Okay.

2
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:06,690
Hello lagers and welcome to this lecture in this lecture we're going to look at the exam blueprint so

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,360
we all want to pass our certified Solutions Architect associate exam.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,240
And before we actually get started learning about AWB it's worth going through the exam blueprint which

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,820
will cover what it is we need to know in order to pass our exams so the exams are 130 minutes in length.

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,280
You're going to have about 60 questions sometimes this can change but hopefully it will never be more

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,390
than 60 and they're all going to be multiple choice.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,200
Sometimes you have to choose one answer.

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,970
Sometimes you have to choose to it it'll tell you and the question how many you have to choose and your

10
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:42,890
results are always going to be between 100 to 1000 and you'll pass mark is 720.

11
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:47,740
So you need to get it roughly about 70 per cent in order to pass the exam.

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:55,050
It's always aimed for 70 per cent the qualification itself is valid for two years and the exam questions

13
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,040
are all going to be a scenario based questions so bear that in mind as well.

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,280
They're never going to ask you you know what is the name of Simple Storage Service which is S3 which

15
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,910
are going to learn as we go forward.

16
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,670
They're going to give you a much more advanced scenario questions and ask you about different use cases.

17
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,950
So let's go over and have a look at how we can book our exams on the AWB website.

18
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:16,630
OK.

19
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:24,030
So here I am in google and I'm going to type in to Google just AWB as certified Solutions Architect

20
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,780
and I'm gonna go ahead and hit enter.

21
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,470
Make sure you click on the top organic link.

22
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,390
Please do not click on my own adverts because you'll cost me money but you'll see the top organic link

23
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,010
is going to be AWB is not Amazon.com.

24
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,680
So we go ahead and click on there.

25
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,420
You'll be able to see an overview of the exam.

26
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,100
It does say down here that you should have one year hands on experience.

27
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,310
Don't worry about that we assume that you know nothing.

28
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,580
In doing this course and you never even logged into AWB before.

29
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,850
We're going to give you all the tools and knowledge that you need to know in order to pass your exam.

30
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,740
So down here we've got everything we just covered.

31
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,280
It's multiple choice and multiple answer questions.

32
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:05,670
If you do need to choose more than one answer it will tell you one hundred and thirty minutes to complete

33
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,800
the exam.

34
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:12,300
The exam registration fee is going to be 150 US dollars and the exams available a whole bunch of different

35
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,660
languages they see down here it says ready to get started.

36
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,140

37
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,920
We'll go ahead and click on AWOL start training.

38
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,830
If it doesn't do anything you do need to enable pop ups.

39
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,470
I don't know why it does that.

40
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,930
Well let's go ahead and just open up AWB start training now in here.

41
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,760
You need to create your AWB certification account when you do create this you may want to use your work

42
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:41,190
email address if you're going to link this back to your organisation or if you want some more flexibility

43
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,070
might want to use your own personal address.

44
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:43,830
It's up to you.

45
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,150

48
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:03,600
need to either create a badge or email in there and if you don't have an account go ahead and create

49
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:03,760
it.

50
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,360
Now have gone ahead and signed into my account.

51
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,790
You'll see as the AWB is training and certification landing page and in here you've got the ability

52
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,630
to schedule a new exam.

53
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:19,860
And down here you'll be able to see your recent activities and you can actually go over to and see your

54
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,220
previous exams you'll see how many exams I've done since teaching AWOL.

55
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,690
I've done an awful lot and haven't passed everything I have failed some other ones.

56
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:33,140
Sometimes their practice exams sometimes they were better when they first came out.

57
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,590
The fact these two ones that I had did fail were the beta exams but I went on to pass them later on.

58
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,750
So you are in really good hands.

59
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,520
I don't know what I'm doing of past an awful lot of AWOL exams.

60
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,060
Once you have passed your exams you're going to get digital badges digital badges badges that you can

61
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,710
use in your signature.

62
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:55,950
The more exams you pass the more badges you get and you'll be able to also go in here and click on benefits

63
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:01,350
and you'll be able to order certain things from the store depending on what exams that you have passed.

64
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,750
So let's go ahead and have a look at how we can book our exams if we click on home.

65
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,820
We'll go ahead to schedule new exam.

66
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:14,370
This is actually open up a new web page which is the PSA exams web page and in here you'll be able to

67
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,730
go and schedule your exams when you are scheduling your exams.

68
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:23,100
Make sure you read them carefully make sure that it is you might get two options like here I've got

69
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,770
the dev ops engineer professional beta I don't know if it's going to let me see the other devils professional

70
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:33,930
because I've only recently just passed that sometimes it will take a little while before you can reset

71
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:34,400
the salmon.

72
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,980
Same exam again.

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,500
But here you can see AWB certified Solutions Architect professional.

74
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,170
So this is the standard exam.

75
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,740
This is the Beta exam.

76
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,530
So do just make sure that you choose the one that is most relevant to you.

77
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:50,030
For me it would be AWB certified Solutions Architect associate.

78
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,520
And that's what you want to find in there.

79
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:57,090
And then all you need to do is go ahead and schedule your exam and that's is it.

80
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,540
It's pretty straightforward.

81
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,640
So now that you know how to schedule your exam.

82
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,560
You're ready to move on to the next section of the course and the next section we're just going to have

83
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,020
a high level overview of eight of us.

84
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,940
Some exam questions are simply understanding what a service is what its use cases.

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,970
So the next section of the course is going to give you a high level overview of every single service

86
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,480
in the AWOL console.

87
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,590
After that section of the course going to start getting our hands dirty we're going to start learning

88
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,570
about identity access management.

89
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,190
So if you've got the time please join me in the next section of the course.

90
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:27,560
Thank you.
