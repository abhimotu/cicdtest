00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,780
<v Lecturer>So let's talk about routing policy</v>

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:04,330
and the first one is going to be Simple Routing Policy.

3
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:06,530
And it's used to map a domain to a URL.

4
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:07,465
So simple, right?

5
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:09,866
We have a web browser and Route 53

6
00:00:09,866 --> 00:00:11,986
and we just say, okay, we wanna know where

7
00:00:11,986 --> 00:00:13,986
is foo.example.com?

8
00:00:13,986 --> 00:00:17,340
Route 53 will reply it is in A record

9
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,340
and the IP is 11.22.33.44.

10
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,280
Excellent!

11
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,970
So we'll just use it basically

12
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,080
when we need to redirect to a single resource.

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,420
It's very easy, simple routing, right?

14
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,990
And the thing is with simple routing,

15
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,320
you can not attach health checks.

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,470
So we have not seen health checks just yet.

17
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,561
We'll see them in a few lectures.

18
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:36,760
But, health checks can not be attached

19
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,310
to simple routing policy.

20
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,244
So it's that easy, very simple.

21
00:00:40,244 --> 00:00:41,964
That's why it's named simple.

22
00:00:41,964 --> 00:00:42,950
In simple though

23
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,150
you can return multiple values to a client

24
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,400
in which case the client sees all the values

25
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,930
and the client will choose a value at random to use.

26
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,520
So let's have a look at how this works in practice.

27
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,280
So in this example, I'm going to create a Record Sets

28
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,090
and I'm going to call it simple.

29
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,380
That's to stephanetheteacher.com.

30
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,730
It's going to be an A record

31
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,200
and the TTL is going to be set to 60 seconds only,

32
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,105
and the value is going to be my URL in,

33
00:01:10,105 --> 00:01:12,920
for example us-west-1.

34
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,600
So I'll just choose this one.

35
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,990
And I'll paste it in.

36
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,280
Click on create and we're done.

37
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,530
Okay, so this was a simple record

38
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,800
and we have a load TTL of 60 seconds to one minute.

39
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,520
And so as you can expect,

40
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,494
if I go to simple.stephanetheteacher.com,

41
00:01:30,494 --> 00:01:32,440
what we see is a Hello World

42
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,070
directly coming from us-east-1a.

43
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,730
If I use Dig to basically query for this URL,

44
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:40,920
what do we learn?

45
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,293
Well, we'll learn that,

46
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,580
and I don't need to use http

47
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,200
otherwise things will not work.

48
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,570
So let's try again.

49
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,940
We'll learn that, yes, we have 59 seconds of TTL left

50
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,810
and the IP result is 3.86.116.186.

51
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,430
Okay, that's as simple as simple gets.

52
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,070
But, we can make this a little bit more complicated.

53
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,794
Basically, by going and adding another IP.

54
00:02:03,794 --> 00:02:06,540
So, for example here, instead of just having

55
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,110
one IP address, I can have multiple IP addresses.

56
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,900
So I'll just chose another one

57
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,850
from my instance in Ireland.

58
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,763
I'll select this IP address.

59
00:02:14,763 --> 00:02:16,260
And as we can see here,

60
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,590
you can basically enter multiple IP addresses

61
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,710
on separate lines.

62
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,760
So here we have two IP addresses

63
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,230
and what this means is that when the web browser

64
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,240
will query for simple.stephanetheteacher.com

65
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,700
it will receive two addresses back.

66
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,338
And then my browser will choose

67
00:02:32,338 --> 00:02:34,350
to which IP to go.

68
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,530
Could be very helpful,

69
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,330
basically if you want the web browser

70
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,020
to start doing some load balancing,

71
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,870
it's called client side load balancing.

72
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,870
So if I use Dig and now query for this little domain,

73
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,529
as we can see now the answer I'm getting back

74
00:02:49,529 --> 00:02:52,020
is that I have two answers.

75
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,230
I have two A records

76
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,460
and two different IP addresses available to me.

77
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,737
Similarly if I go and open up

78
00:02:59,737 --> 00:03:03,350
the back my simple.stephanetheteacher.com URL,

79
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,320
with a bit of luck

80
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,070
I've been transferred to eu-west-1c.

81
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,710
And so if I refresh this page

82
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,020
for 60 seconds it's for sure always

83
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,930
going to go to eu-west-1c,

84
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,970
but after 60 seconds my web browser

85
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,820
will make another DNS request

86
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,650
and there's a chance I will fall back

87
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,300
to this value again.

88
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,579
So it's something very important to see.

89
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:25,662
It's simple, but as we go along in this section,

90
00:03:25,662 --> 00:03:27,560
we'll see more complicated policies

91
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,720
and it's always nice to start

92
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,540
with something a little bit simple.

93
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,373
So have a play.

94
00:03:31,373 --> 00:03:32,460
Play with the TTL.

95
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,860
Play with the different IPs.

96
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,300
Play with Dig or nslookup

97
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,250
and I will see you in the next lecture.
