1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,443
Okay, see we are getting into the first fun

2
00:00:02,443 --> 00:00:04,769
service of AWS which is Amazon EC2.

3
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:07,041
So when you start with AWS you kinda want

4
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:08,477
to start over there because

5
00:00:08,477 --> 00:00:10,051
that is kind of the basis of AWS.

6
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:12,901
That's how Amazon used to work for a very long time.

7
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:14,469
Now it's no more Serverless as we'll

8
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:15,685
see in this course as well.

9
00:00:15,685 --> 00:00:18,023
But EC2, you have to start there.

10
00:00:18,023 --> 00:00:21,337
So, it's one of the most popular of AWS server accesses

11
00:00:21,337 --> 00:00:23,544
and basically it consists of the capability of

12
00:00:23,544 --> 00:00:25,689
launching virtual machines in the cloud,

13
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:28,685
okay, but also storing data on virtual drives,

14
00:00:28,685 --> 00:00:32,045
that's called EBS, distributing load across machines,

15
00:00:32,045 --> 00:00:34,016
that's called ELB, or load balancing,

16
00:00:34,016 --> 00:00:37,830
and scaling servers using an auto-scaling group, or ASG.

17
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,826
So it uncompasses a lot of different services.

18
00:00:40,826 --> 00:00:43,707
Knowing EC2 for me, it's fundamental to understanding

19
00:00:43,707 --> 00:00:44,806
how the Cloud works.

20
00:00:44,806 --> 00:00:46,201
This is where the revolution started,

21
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:48,598
it's the ability to just start a machine right away,

22
00:00:48,598 --> 00:00:51,655
and we need to start there to understand how Serverless

23
00:00:51,655 --> 00:00:54,166
later on makes a difference.

24
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:55,924
So, in this first hands-on,

25
00:00:55,924 --> 00:00:59,186
I want to launch an EC2 Instance running Linux.

26
00:00:59,186 --> 00:01:01,035
And so we'll be launching our first server

27
00:01:01,035 --> 00:01:02,605
and we'll use the AWS Console

28
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:04,990
and this will give us a high level overview

29
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:07,445
of the various parameters that we'll have in this course,

30
00:01:07,445 --> 00:01:09,090
and for the EC2 launching.

31
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,639
But, we will go over them one-by-one

32
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:13,952
in much great details in the next lecture.

33
00:01:13,952 --> 00:01:17,301
We'll learn how to start, stop, and terminate our instances.

34
00:01:17,301 --> 00:01:18,664
Okay, that's super important.

35
00:01:18,664 --> 00:01:21,430
Just to get a feeling of how things work.

36
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,947
So without further ado, lets get started.

37
00:01:23,947 --> 00:01:25,910
Okay, so I am in my AWS Console,

38
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,950
and all the EC2 link is right here.

39
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,220
I want you to get used to writing EC2 in the search bar

40
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,280
and just getting the first link.

41
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,027
So, first make sure that you are in the region

42
00:01:36,027 --> 00:01:38,350
that's close to you, okay, for me it's EU Paris.

43
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,180
But based on where you are in the world,

44
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,840
please choose the region that makes the most sense

45
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,820
for you to use EC2 in.

46
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,718
So we are in the EC2 Console, and as you can see,

47
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:49,465
pretty much nothing's happening,

48
00:01:49,465 --> 00:01:50,890
we have zero running instances,

49
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,457
a bunch of things in one security group.

50
00:01:53,457 --> 00:01:55,713
So basically, this is the basis of things,

51
00:01:55,713 --> 00:01:58,710
but the first thing we want to do is to launch an Instance.

52
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,116
So there's this big blue button right here

53
00:02:00,116 --> 00:02:01,696
to launch an instance.

54
00:02:01,696 --> 00:02:04,116
Now, when I click on it, the first thing I land on

55
00:02:04,116 --> 00:02:06,776
is creating an, choosing an AMI.

56
00:02:06,776 --> 00:02:09,713
So AMI stands for Amazon Machine Image.

57
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:12,217
And this is basically the software and the operating system

58
00:02:12,217 --> 00:02:14,686
that will be launched on that server.

59
00:02:14,686 --> 00:02:17,907
Now, there is a bunch of distribution that you may recognize

60
00:02:17,907 --> 00:02:21,996
such as Ubuntu or Redhats or Microsoft Windows,

61
00:02:21,996 --> 00:02:23,016
et cetera, et cetera.

62
00:02:23,016 --> 00:02:24,766
In this course it's for the certification.

63
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:28,564
It's much better if we go using the Amazon Linux AMI

64
00:02:28,564 --> 00:02:31,506
because they come with a lot of Amazon specific stuff.

65
00:02:31,506 --> 00:02:34,696
Especially recently, Amazon Linux 2 came out,

66
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,886
and to me, it's kind of what you have to use today.

67
00:02:37,886 --> 00:02:41,779
Because it's for how Amazon sees you using Linux.

68
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:43,854
And so we'll use Amazon Linux too.

69
00:02:43,854 --> 00:02:45,751
And the thing is, I'm telling you this because

70
00:02:45,751 --> 00:02:47,487
if you use Amazon Linux for this tutorial,

71
00:02:47,487 --> 00:02:49,906
the commands are going to be slightly different,

72
00:02:49,906 --> 00:02:53,261
and because I want you to use the exact same setup as me,

73
00:02:53,261 --> 00:02:54,407
the exact same tooling,

74
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,034
I would like you to choose Amazon Linux too.

75
00:02:57,034 --> 00:02:59,196
Now if you notice something on the left-hand side,

76
00:02:59,196 --> 00:03:01,068
it says Free Tier Eligible.

77
00:03:01,068 --> 00:03:03,082
So yes, we are going to try to remain

78
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:04,771
all the way in the free tier

79
00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:06,756
when you start your A list accounts.

80
00:03:06,756 --> 00:03:08,236
So when you start working with Amazon,

81
00:03:08,236 --> 00:03:09,731
they give you a bunch of free stuff

82
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,848
to try out their services, such as we are doing right now,

83
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:13,784
and it's much better for me and for you

84
00:03:13,784 --> 00:03:15,426
if we manage to remain free.

85
00:03:15,426 --> 00:03:17,381
So we'll choose something that is Free Tier eligible.

86
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:19,894
We'll choose Amazon Linux 2.

87
00:03:19,894 --> 00:03:21,467
We'll select the AMI,

88
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:24,526
and now we have to choose a type of machine we have.

89
00:03:24,526 --> 00:03:27,531
So when you select an EC2 machine, you can select the type.

90
00:03:27,531 --> 00:03:28,746
And basically the type is saying,

91
00:03:28,746 --> 00:03:31,174
"how powerful you want your machine to be?

92
00:03:31,174 --> 00:03:33,915
How many VCP views do you want it to have?

93
00:03:33,915 --> 00:03:35,821
And how much memory do you want it to have?"

94
00:03:35,821 --> 00:03:38,491
If you scroll down this page you can see there is a lot

95
00:03:38,491 --> 00:03:41,058
of different machine types, okay, a lot of them,

96
00:03:41,058 --> 00:03:44,101
but only one of them is free tier eligible.

97
00:03:44,101 --> 00:03:45,757
So we'll just go for t2.micro.

98
00:03:45,757 --> 00:03:47,841
In the next lecture, we'll learn about the differences

99
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:49,441
and why there are so many names,

100
00:03:49,441 --> 00:03:51,828
but for now, lets just go and use t2.micro.

101
00:03:51,828 --> 00:03:54,283
Now I could go ahead and click on review and launch,

102
00:03:54,283 --> 00:03:56,021
it's the big blue button and it's quite tempting,

103
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:59,191
but I will just do Next Configure Instance Detail.

104
00:03:59,191 --> 00:04:00,551
That's because I want to show you

105
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:02,930
all the parameters that are available for you.

106
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,182
So now, we're getting into a lot of parameters,

107
00:04:06,182 --> 00:04:08,537
and you may be overwhelmed right now, but don't worry,

108
00:04:08,537 --> 00:04:11,712
overtime, over the lessons, and the next lectures and so on,

109
00:04:11,712 --> 00:04:14,128
you will become much more familiar with them.

110
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,782
Number of Instances we want to launch is 1.

111
00:04:16,782 --> 00:04:18,170
That sounds about right.

112
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,250
I will not Request Spot Instances,

113
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,931
we want an on-demand instance,

114
00:04:21,931 --> 00:04:23,754
so we'll not check this box.

115
00:04:23,754 --> 00:04:26,410
Now the Network, is around VPC and Subnet.

116
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,390
Now, when you create the name of this accounts

117
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,540
it comes with something called a default VPC.

118
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,817
So we'll just use the default VPC right here,

119
00:04:32,817 --> 00:04:34,530
and the subnet is basically saying

120
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,971
in which AZ, availability zone,

121
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:38,824
do you want your Instance to be?

122
00:04:38,824 --> 00:04:41,060
So, I'll say no preference because I have no preference.

123
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,780
But as you can see, what from before,

124
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,359
when I talked about AZ,

125
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:47,030
we can see now we have eu-west-3a, b, and c,

126
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,768
and we can choose to launch our Instance

127
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:51,195
in one of these data centers, or AZ.

128
00:04:51,195 --> 00:04:53,713
Same wise, I will auto-assign a Public IP,

129
00:04:53,713 --> 00:04:56,227
and I will just use the subnet setting.

130
00:04:56,227 --> 00:04:57,884
Now we don't need a IAM role,

131
00:04:57,884 --> 00:04:59,926
we'll see IAM roles in great depth in the next section.

132
00:04:59,926 --> 00:05:01,299
The shut down behaviors,

133
00:05:01,299 --> 00:05:04,513
that if I shut down a machine it will stop, and so on.

134
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:05,951
All of this looks good.

135
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:07,768
All of this are pretty much advanced parameters

136
00:05:07,768 --> 00:05:09,328
that we'll see in the later on.

137
00:05:09,328 --> 00:05:11,548
Then there is admin's details and spin code user data,

138
00:05:11,548 --> 00:05:13,840
and I have a lecture dedicated to this.

139
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,054
Now click on storage, basically when you start an Instance

140
00:05:17,054 --> 00:05:18,972
okay, right now, we started with pretty much

141
00:05:18,972 --> 00:05:20,491
all the default settings.

142
00:05:20,491 --> 00:05:21,608
When you start a Instance,

143
00:05:21,608 --> 00:05:23,842
it has to have it's operating system somewhere,

144
00:05:23,842 --> 00:05:27,111
and that's a disc, and basically that's called storage.

145
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:28,761
So, storage is EBS volume.

146
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:30,953
And currently, we just want the root storage,

147
00:05:30,953 --> 00:05:33,409
so that's where our operating system is going to run.

148
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:35,821
And we'll leave it at /dev/xvda.

149
00:05:35,821 --> 00:05:38,058
We'll leave it at eight gigabyte of space,

150
00:05:38,058 --> 00:05:40,051
and we'll leave it as SSD.

151
00:05:40,051 --> 00:05:41,761
All of this is very important.

152
00:05:41,761 --> 00:05:46,506
And as you can see, by default, when this is terminated,

153
00:05:46,506 --> 00:05:49,023
so is the root volume because this is ticked,

154
00:05:49,023 --> 00:05:50,521
and I'll leave it like this.

155
00:05:50,521 --> 00:05:52,261
Finally, you'll see it's not encrypted.

156
00:05:52,261 --> 00:05:54,751
We'll talk about EBS encryption later on.

157
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:57,531
Now when you launch an instance, we can add tags.

158
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:59,945
And Tags are basically key value pairs,

159
00:05:59,945 --> 00:06:01,927
which allow you to just identify that

160
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:03,666
Instance and classify it.

161
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,401
For example, the first type that is going

162
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:06,993
to be very important is the name tag.

163
00:06:06,993 --> 00:06:09,870
And, we'll say, My First Instance, okay.

164
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,184
And, you can have it whatever you want.

165
00:06:12,184 --> 00:06:14,940
You can add another tag and say, you know,

166
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,523
another tag, another key, and then another value.

167
00:06:18,523 --> 00:06:21,183
It's whatever you want, okay, you're free to have

168
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,573
tags of whatever you want.

169
00:06:22,573 --> 00:06:24,173
But the name tag is going to be quite important

170
00:06:24,173 --> 00:06:26,123
because it's going to show in the UI.

171
00:06:26,123 --> 00:06:27,983
Now security group wise,

172
00:06:27,983 --> 00:06:30,076
this is basically going to be a firewall

173
00:06:30,076 --> 00:06:32,283
around your Instance, okay.

174
00:06:32,283 --> 00:06:34,430
And so, when we get started with our Instance,

175
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,167
the first thing we want to under Linux

176
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:38,663
is make sure we can SSH into it.

177
00:06:38,663 --> 00:06:41,363
So there's an SSH rule, and then you can define a port,

178
00:06:41,363 --> 00:06:43,574
and you can define a source.

179
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:46,973
Currently, I will go and create a new security group,

180
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,823
okay, which, um, in terms of name I'll just

181
00:06:49,823 --> 00:06:53,073
call it, My First Security Group, okay.

182
00:06:54,075 --> 00:06:55,495
And in the description I'll say,

183
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:58,412
created with my first EC2 instance.

184
00:07:00,308 --> 00:07:04,826
And I will allow SSH, on Port 22, and the source currently,

185
00:07:04,826 --> 00:07:07,376
I'll just leave it as 0.0.0.0/0,

186
00:07:07,376 --> 00:07:09,576
it's got quite a bit criterias you could setup as my IP

187
00:07:09,576 --> 00:07:11,646
if just you wanted yo use that port,

188
00:07:11,646 --> 00:07:13,366
but to make things super simple right now and not

189
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:16,976
overload you, we will set it as Custom 0.0.0.0/0,

190
00:07:16,976 --> 00:07:18,574
which means, any IP.

191
00:07:18,574 --> 00:07:22,529
Now description, is something new, but you can say SSH

192
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:25,919
to the instance, and if you don't want know what SSH is,

193
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,759
just wait until the next lecture.

194
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,465
Now we'll review a Launch it, and we'll get a big warning

195
00:07:31,465 --> 00:07:34,198
saying "Your security group is open to the world."

196
00:07:34,198 --> 00:07:36,939
So, 0.0.0.0/0 is not best practice,

197
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:40,120
so we get a bit of a warning here, but that's okay,

198
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,268
and here we can review all the parameters that we've had.

199
00:07:43,268 --> 00:07:44,110
Okay.

200
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,920
So, everything looks good, okay.

201
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,838
Just make sure you have a t2.micro,

202
00:07:47,838 --> 00:07:50,840
and make sure you use Amazon Linux 2, okay,

203
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,193
But everything looks fine.

204
00:07:52,193 --> 00:07:53,451
So we'll click on Launch.

205
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:54,840
And the last thing we have to do when we click

206
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,066
on Launch is to create a key pair.

207
00:07:57,066 --> 00:07:59,550
Now, basically a key pair is what's going to give

208
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,217
you access to log in to, or to SSH into the,

209
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,856
a machine you just launched.

210
00:08:05,856 --> 00:08:07,847
And so right now we have no key pair so you can

211
00:08:07,847 --> 00:08:09,906
import key pairs if you already have key pairs.

212
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,155
But, for this case, we will go and create

213
00:08:12,155 --> 00:08:13,405
a new key pair.

214
00:08:14,336 --> 00:08:19,249
And for this key pair, I'll call this EC2 tutorial.

215
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,546
The next step is for me to download that key pair,

216
00:08:21,546 --> 00:08:25,181
and it downloads a EC2T tutorial.pem file,

217
00:08:25,181 --> 00:08:27,866
and then I click on launch instances.

218
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:29,833
So that's about right, and then we click

219
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,596
on view instances in the bottom right,

220
00:08:31,596 --> 00:08:34,924
and we end up with our first instance starting.

221
00:08:34,924 --> 00:08:37,139
So as you can see now, our instance is started,

222
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:39,926
we can see the instance type, it's my t2 micro,

223
00:08:39,926 --> 00:08:42,016
the availability zone it was launched in,

224
00:08:42,016 --> 00:08:44,915
so for me it's eu-west-3c, and the Instance state

225
00:08:44,915 --> 00:08:46,965
which is pending so it's being created.

226
00:08:46,965 --> 00:08:49,499
Everything looks good, and we'll see how we deal

227
00:08:49,499 --> 00:08:51,377
with the IP's in the next lecture.

228
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:54,911
As we can see the tag here, My First Instance was used

229
00:08:54,911 --> 00:08:57,156
under the Name column, so basically our Instance

230
00:08:57,156 --> 00:08:59,243
was being named , which is great,

231
00:08:59,243 --> 00:09:01,581
and so we are good to go.

232
00:09:01,581 --> 00:09:03,270
Now one thing I want to show you is that once

233
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,673
the Instance is started, we have a green running, okay.

234
00:09:06,673 --> 00:09:08,399
And green running means that Instance is started

235
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,959
and you can be billed.

236
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,104
This is a t2.micro so it's a free tier user

237
00:09:12,104 --> 00:09:13,942
so you won't be billed for this Instance,

238
00:09:13,942 --> 00:09:15,416
but basically if it was another Instance

239
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,196
you start getting billed.

240
00:09:17,196 --> 00:09:19,969
If you right click on it, you can stop, reboot,

241
00:09:19,969 --> 00:09:21,388
or terminate an Instance.

242
00:09:21,388 --> 00:09:24,181
If you stop it, it will just not bill you for it,

243
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:25,469
and the Instance will be stopped.

244
00:09:25,469 --> 00:09:27,239
If you reboot it, it's what you expect it to be ,

245
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:28,759
like your computer it will reboot it.

246
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,671
And if you terminate it, you basically saying,

247
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:32,939
"I want it no more , don't save the data,

248
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,319
just take it away from me,"

249
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:36,269
and basically you won't be able to access

250
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:38,129
your Instance ever again, okay.

251
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:40,481
So this is very very quick.

252
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:42,399
For now, we'll just keep the Instance running

253
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,089
because we have to do tutorial with it.

254
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:46,067
So, we'll see you in the next lecture to show

255
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:49,019
you how we can access it, SSH into it from either

256
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,863
Linux, MAC, or Windows.

257
00:09:50,863 --> 00:09:52,721
So see you in the next lecture.
